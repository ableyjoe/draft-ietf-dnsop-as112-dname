    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4
	addresses that are not globally unique. Examples are the
	addresses designated in <xref target="RFC1918"/> for private
	use within individual sites.</t>

      <t>Devices in such environments may occasionally originate
	Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups")
	corresponding to those private-use addresses. Since the
	addresses concerned have only local significance, it is
	good practice for site administrators to ensure that such
	queries are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon
	for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in
	the public DNS instead of being answered within the site.</t>

      <t>It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful
	answers to such queries. In addition, due to the wide
	deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing
	growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large
	and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed
	sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the
	IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers. The AS112 project is
	named after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was
	assigned to it.</t>

      <t>Prior to implementation of this technique, the AS112 project
	did not accommodate the addition and removal of DNS zones
	elegantly. Since additional zones of definitively local
	significance are known to exist, this presents a problem.
	This document describes modifications to the deployment and
	use of AS112 infrastructure that will allow zones to be
	added and dropped much more easily.</t>

      <t>The AS112 project is described in detail in <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc6304bis"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The AS112 nameservers (PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG
	and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG) are required to answer authoritatively
	for each and every zone that is delegated to them.  If a
	zone is delegated to AS112 nameservers without those
	nameservers being configured ahead of time to answer
	authoritatively for that zone, there is a detrimental impact
	on clients following referrals for queries within that zone.
	This misconfiguration is colloquially known as a "lame
	delegation".</t>

      <t>AS112 nameserver operators are only loosely-coordinated,
	and hence adding support for a new zone (or, correspondingly,
	removing support for a zone that is no longer delegated to
	the AS112 nameservers) is difficult to accomplish with
	accuracy. Testing AS112 nameservers remotely to see whether
	they are configured to answer authoritatively for a particular
	zone is similarly challenging since AS112 nodes are distributed
	using <xref target="RFC4786">anycast</xref>.</t>

      <t>This document defines a more flexible approach for sinking
	queries on AS112 infrastructure that can be deployed alongside
	unmodified, existing AS112 nodes. Instead of delegating
	additional zones directly to AS112 nameservers, <xref
	target="RFC6672">DNAME</xref> redirection is used.  This
	approach has the advantage that query traffic for arbitrary
	parts of the namespace can be directed to AS112 servers
	without those servers having to be reconfigured every time
	a zone is added or removed.</t>

      <t>This approach makes it possible for any DNS zone administrator
	to sink traffic relating to parts of the global DNS namespace
	under their control to the AS112 infrastructure without
	coordination with the operators of AS112 infrastructure.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Design Overview">
      <t>A new zone, EMPTY.AS112.ARPA, is delegated to a single
        nameserver BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA (IPv4 address TBAv4-1, IPv6
        address TBAv6-1).</t>

      <t>The IPv4 address TBAv4-1 has been assigned by the IANA
	such that the address is coverable by a single IPv4 /24
	prefix, and that no other address covered by that prefix
	is in use.  The IPv6 address TBAv6-1 has been similarly
	assigned such that no other address within a covering /48
	is in use. This addressing plan accommodates the anycast
	distribution of the BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA service using a
	single IPv4 service prefix and a single IPv6 service prefix.
	See <xref target="RFC4786"></xref> for more discussion of
	anycast service distribution; see <xref target="iana"></xref>
	for the specific requests this document makes of the IANA.</t>

      <t>Some or all of the existing AS112 nodes SHOULD be extended
	to support these new nameserver addresses, and to host the
	EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.  See <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc6304bis"></xref> for revised
	guidance to AS112 server operators.</t>

      <t>Each part of the DNS namespace for which it is desirable
	to sink queries at AS112 nameservers should be redirected
	to the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone using <xref
	target="RFC6672">DNAME</xref>.  See <xref
	target="redirection"></xref> for guidance to zone
	administrators.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="AS112 Operations">
      <section anchor="extensions"
          title="Extensions to Support DNAME Redirection">
	<t>Guidance to operators of AS112 nodes is extended to
	  include configuration of the TBAv4-1, and TBAv6-1 addresses,
	  and the corresponding announcement of covering routes for
	  those addresses, and to host the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.</t>

	<t>IPv4-only AS112 nodes should only configure the TBAv4-1
	  nameserver address; IPv6-only AS112 nodes should only
	  configure the TBAv6-1 nameserver address.</t>

	<t>It is only necessary for a single AS112 server operator
	  to implement these extensions for this mechanism to
	  function as intended.  It is beneficial if many more than
	  one AS112 server operators make these changes, however,
	  since that provides for greater distribution and capacity
	  for the nameservers serving the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.
	  It is not necessary for all AS112 server operators to
	  make these changes for the mechanism to be viable.</t>

	<t>Detailed instructions for the implementation of these
	  extensions is included in <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc6304bis"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="redirection"
          title="Redirection of Query Traffic to AS112 Servers">
	<t>Once the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone has been deployed using
	  the nameservers described in <xref target="extensions"></xref>,
	  redirections may be installed in the DNS namespace for
	  queries that are intended to be answered by the AS112
	  infrastructure.</t>

	<t>For example, reverse queries corresponding to <xref
	  target="RFC5737">TEST-NET-1 (192.0.2.0/24)</xref> could
	  be redirected to AS112 nameservers by installing a DNAME
	  resource record in the 192.IN-ADDR.ARPA zone, as illustrated
	  in <xref target="TEST-NET-1"></xref>.</t>

        <figure anchor="TEST-NET-1">
          <artwork><![CDATA[
  $ORIGIN 192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.
  ...
  2.0     IN      DNAME   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.
  ...
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

	<t>There is no practical limit to the number of redirections
	  that can be configured in this fashion. Redirection of a
	  particular part of the namespace to EMPTY.AS112.ARPA can
	  be removed at any time, under the control of the
	  administrators of the corresponding part of the DNS
	  namespace. No changes to deployed AS112 nodes incorporating
	  the extensions described in this document are required
	  to support additional redirections. A list of possible
	  candidates for AS112 redirection can be found in <xref
	  target="candidates"></xref>.</t>

	<t>DNAME resource records deployed for this purpose can be
	  signed with <xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref>, providing
	  a secure means of authenticating the legitimacy of each
	  redirection.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Continuity of AS112 Operations">
      <t>Existing guidance to AS112 server operators to accept and
	respond to queries directed at the PRISONER.IANA.ORG,
	BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG nameservers
	should continue to be followed, and no changes to the
	delegation of existing zones hosted on AS112 servers should
	occur. These measures are intended to provide continuity
	of operations for zones currently delegated to AS112 servers
	and avoid any accidental client impact due to the changes
	proposed in this document.</t>

      <t>Once it has become empirically and quantitatively clear
	that the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone is well-hosted to the extent
	that it is thought that the existing, unmodified AS112
	servers host 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA, the decision might be made
	to replace the delegation of those <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
	zones with DNAME redirection. Once implemented, the
	PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG
	nameservers could be retired. This document gives no such
	direction to the IANA, however.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="candidates" title="Candidate Zones for AS112 Redirection">
      <t>All zones listed in <xref target="RFC6303"></xref> are
        candidates for AS112 redirection.</t>

      <t>Since no pre-provisioning is required on the part of AS112
	operators to facilitate sinking of any name in the DNS
	namespace by AS112 infrastructure, this mechanism supports
	AS112 redirection by any zone owner in the DNS.</t>

      <t>This document is simply concerned with provision of the
	AS112 redirection service, and does not specify that any
	particular AS112 redirection be put in place.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DNAME Deployment Considerations">
      <t>DNAME was specified years after the original implementations
	of <xref target="RFC1035"></xref>, and hence universal
	deployment cannot be expected. <xref target="RFC6672"></xref>
	specifies a fall-back mechanism which makes use of synthesised
	CNAME RRSets for this reason. The expectation that design
	choices in the DNAME specification ought to mitigate any
	lack of deployment is reviewed below. Experimental validation
	of those expectations is included in <xref
	target="experiment"></xref>.</t>

      <t>It is a fundamental design requirement of AS112 service
	that responses be cached. We can safely declare DNAME support
	on the authoritative server to be a prerequisite for DNAME
	redirection, but the cases where individual elements in
	resolver chains do not support DNAME processing deserve
	closer examination.</t>

      <t>The expected behaviour when a DNAME response is supplied
	to a resolver that does not support DNAME is that the
	accompanying, synthesised CNAME will be accepted and cached.
	Re-query frequency will be determined by the TTLs returned
	by the DNAME-responding authoritative servers.</t>

      <t>Resolution of the CNAME target is straightforward and
	functions exactly as the AS112 project has operated since
	it was deployed. The <xref target="RFC2308">negative
	caching</xref> of the CNAME target follows the parameters
	defined in the target zone, EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.  This has the
	side-effects that all redirected names ultimately landing
	on an AS112 node will be negatively-cached with the same
	parameters, but this lack of flexibility seems non-controversial;
	the effect of reducing the negative cache TTL would be
	increased query volume on the AS112 node operator concerned,
	and hence controls seem well-aligned with operation.</t>

      <t>Validating resolvers (i.e. those requesting and processing
	<xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref> metadata) are required
	to implement DNAME, and hence should not make use of
	synthesised CNAME RRs. The lack of signature over a received
	CNAME RR should hence not limit the ability to sign the
	redirection point, and for those signatures to be validated.</t>

      <t>In the case where a recursive server implements DNAME, but
	DNAME is not implemented in a stub resolver, CNAME synthesis
	will again provide a viable path.</t>

      <t>DNAME support on AS112 nodes themselves is never required
        under this proposal.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IAB Considerations">
      <t>This document proposes a delegation within the ARPA domain,
	and, in accordance with <xref target="RFC3172"></xref>, IAB
	review and approval of the delegation of AS112.ARPA as
	described in <xref target="iana"></xref> is required.</t>

      <t>Once IAB approval has been obtained, this section may be
	removed prior to publication or updated to include text
	that confirms the IAB's decision, at the IAB's discretion.</t>

        title="Assessing Support for DNAME in the Real World">
      <t>To measure the extent to which the DNAME construct is
	supported in the Internet, we have used an experimental
	technique to test the DNS resolvers used by end hosts, and
	derive from the test a measurement of DNAME support within
	the Internet.</t>

      <section title="Methodology">
	<t>The test was conducted by loading a user's browser with
	  4 URLs to retrieve. The first three comprise the test
	  setup, while the final URL communicates the result the
	  the experiment controller. The URLs are: <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="A">http://a.&lt;unique_string&gt;.dname.example.com/1x1.png?<vspace blankLines="0" />a.&lt;unique_string&gt;.dname</t>

            <t hangText="B">http://b.dname.example.com/1x1.png?<vspace blankLines="0" />b.&lt;unique_string&gt;.dname</t>

            <t hangText="C">http://c.&lt;unique_string&gt;.target.example.net/1x1.png?<vspace blankLines="0" />c.&lt;unique_string&gt;.target</t>

            <t hangText="D">http://results.recorder.example.net/1x1.png?<vspace blankLines="0" />results.&lt;unique_string&gt;?za=&lt;a_result&gt;&amp;zb=&lt;b_result&gt;&amp;zc=&lt;c_result&gt;</t>
          </list></t>

	<t>The A URL is designed to test the end users capability
	  to resolve a name that has never been seen before, so
	  that the resolution of this domain name will reliably
	  result in a query at the authoritative name server. This
	  is intended to test the use of domain names where there
	  is a dynamic component that also uses the DNAME construct.</t>

	<t>The B URL is deliberately designed to be cached by caching
	  resolvers that are used in the process of resolving the
	  domain name.</t>

	<t>The C URL is a control URL. This is a unique URL, similar
	  to A, but does not refer to a DNAME structure.</t>

        <t>The D URL uses a static cacheable domain name.</t>

	<t>The &lt;unique_string&gt; value is common to the four
	  URLs used in each individual instance of this test, but
	  varies from test to test.  The result is that each end
	  user is presented with a unique string.</t>

	<t>The contents of the EXAMPLE.COM, TARGET.EXAMPLE.NET and
	  RECORDER.EXAMPLE.NET zones are shown in <xref
	  target="experiment-zones"></xref>.</t>

	<t>The first three URLs (A, B and C) are loaded as tasks
	  into the user's browser upon execution of the test's
	  script.  The script starts a timer with each of these
	  URLs to measure the elapsed time to fetch the URL. The
	  script then waits for the three fetches to complete, or
	  10 seconds, whichever occurs first. The script then loads
	  the results of the three timers into the GET arguments
	  of the D URL, and performs a fetch to pass these results
	  back to the experiment's server.</t>

	<t>Logs on the web server reached at RESULTS.EXAMPLE.NET
	  will include entries of the form shown in <xref
	  target="experiment-results"></xref>. If any of the URLs
	  fail to load within 10 secords the D URL will report the
	  failure as a "null" timer value.</t>

	<t>The script has been encoded in Adobe Flash with a simple
	  image in the form of an online advertisement. An online
	  advertisement network has been used to distribute the
	  script.  The script is invoked when the advertisement is
	  presented in the end user's browser or application, and
	  does not require the user to click on the supplied image
	  in any way.  The advertisement placement parameters were
	  set to to broadest possible scope to sample users from
	  across the entire internet.</t>

	<t>These results indicate that at most 1.9% of tested clients
	  use DNS resolvers that fail to resolve a domain name that
	  contains a DNAME redirection. However the failure rate
	  of slightly lower than 3% for the control URL indicates
	  that the failure rate for the DNAME construct lies within
	  the bounds of error within the experimental framework.
	  We conclude that there is no evidence of a consistent
	  failure on the part of deployed DNS resolvers to correctly
	  resolve a DNAME construct.</t>
